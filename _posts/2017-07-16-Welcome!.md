*Welcome to the SlyHost UK Blog!*

This blog will consist of guides and overviews of various open source Linuxy goodness and a whole bunch of virtualization.

This site is being produced using a series of free tools and running from GitHub pages via Netlify as a CMS and CDN. All free and no servers to manage... Awesome.
