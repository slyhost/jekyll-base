Here's the thing, in every network, a choice needs to be made. Do you keep everything locked down and as secure as possible, or do you open up a few ports on the firewall to let people remotely manage things?

_Yeah, Neither works. _

Everything these days seems to be secure, or not. If you try to make things secure, people will complain. Then if you make it insecure, people complain when stuff gets hacked into, or ends up with ransomware. You can't win. 

The major flaw when it comes to most systems is people's obsessions with making things easy for end users. No matter how many policies  you set up to enforce good passwords or to make everyone change them every 30 seconds, people are going to find a way around it... Let's face it, **people are lazy** and lazy people will find a way to do things the easiest way possible. 

For example:

* Password policy? 
  * Write the password on a post-it and stick it on the screen
* U2F Authentication? 
  * Keep the YubiKey/Smart card plugged in at all times
* Can't get to things from home?
  * Copy everything to a USB drive and take it all home
* Blocked websites? 
  * Tether to someone's phone

The list can go on and on, I'm sure you get the idea by now. People are the weakest link in networks and this is easily proven by the many hacks that are showing online of humans clicking links in emails and infecting entire organizations with ransomware, or leaked information getting out from someone logging into a dodgy website with their work credentials. Not only do you have to protect your network from outsiders, its the insiders that can do the real damage...
